# ✅ Jarvis is Working!

## Status: All Systems Operational

Your terminal shows that Jarvis:
- ✅ Loaded successfully
- ✅ All components initialized
- ✅ All handlers registered
- ✅ Ready to receive commands

## Why It Looks Like It's "Not Running"

When you run `venv\Scripts\python.exe jarvis_simple.py` **directly in terminal**, it expects you to type commands.

The terminal is **waiting for your input** after showing:
```
You: _
```

You need to **type a command** like:
- `help`
- `what time is it`
- `set timer for 30 seconds`
